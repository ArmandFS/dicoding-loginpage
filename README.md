# Simple Login Application
This is an application for logging in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I acquired this program from dicoding's intro to modifying software course.

How the login works:
1. Enter email and password
2. If input does not contain "@" symbol, retry until occurance
3. If Correct, send to Home Menu
4. If Incorrect, you will stay at the login page.
